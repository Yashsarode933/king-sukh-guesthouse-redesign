| Challenge                                       | Solution                                                                                                   |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Original site was not mobile-friendly           | Implemented a mobile-first approach using CSS Grid, Flexbox, and media queries within CSS Modules.           |
| Managing image optimization and loading speed   | Leveraged Next.js's built-in `<Image>` component for automatic optimization, resizing, and lazy loading.     |
| Creating a maintainable styling system          | Used CSS Modules to scope styles to individual components, preventing class name conflicts.                |
| Implementing a functional image gallery         | Integrated the `yet-another-react-lightbox` library and managed its state with React's `useState` hook.    |
| Ensuring consistent navigation across all pages | Created a reusable `<Navbar />` component and made it sticky using `position: fixed` and global CSS padding. |

-   **Real Booking System:** Develop a backend and database to handle real-time room bookings and availability.
-   **Advanced Animations:** Incorporate libraries like `Framer Motion` to add on-scroll reveal animations and more complex transitions.
-   **Enhanced SEO:** Implement dynamic metadata generation for each page to improve search engine visibility.
